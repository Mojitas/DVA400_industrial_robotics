### Try to create a branch instead of updating the master branch directly

### Add other respositories by adding subfolders

### Use Gitkraken preferably. :)

#### Git cli cheat sheet
[Cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

* Add files/changes to repository: __git add [file]__ 

* Commit files/changes to repository with a message: __git commit -m "Message"__

* Pull BEFORE pushing anything: __git pull__

* Upload files to repository: __git push__

* Did you fuck up?: __git reset or git rm [file]__

#### Working from an other branch?

* Remember to check that you're on the right branch when committing.

* Add changes to your branch as described above.

* Check out master branch and merge <your branch> into master to apply your changes to master.
